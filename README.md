# AeroWeather-Responsive-Weather-Forecast-App-
AeroWeather is a sleek, responsive web application that provides real-time weather updates for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, it displays essential weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, coordinates, sunrise & sunset times, and dynamically changes weather icons based on live data.

The project emphasizes a clean, modern UI with smooth animations, mobile responsiveness, and an intuitive search experience. It demonstrates practical skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch + async/await), DOM manipulation, and responsive web design principles.
